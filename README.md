# README

This is a simple Rails API I built to feed data to the [bookstore app](https://github.com/kiramclean/bookstore) I built to learn about ember js.

It requires `ruby 2.3.1`

*To run*:
- clone the repo and run `bin/setup`
- launch the server with `rails s`
- seed the database with `rails db:seed`
